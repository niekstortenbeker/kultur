### Collect and combine programs from theaters in Bremen
This command line tool collects the program of theaters I like in bremen. It filters out dubbed movies (because who likes those?), and then combines the programs to one sorted-by-date overview. 


#### usage:
Display this week's program that was stored on disk:    
`scripts/run.py`  
  
Display a new program (uses web scraping):  
`scripts/run.py -n`

Display only today:  
`scripts/run.py -t`
